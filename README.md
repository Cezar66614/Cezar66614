- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m K32ar(@Cezar66614)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OS making and Game Engine development in C and C++
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at my email address: cezarrusu20.000@gmail.com

If you have any suggestions for any of my projects please leave me a message. If I like it we could get in contact and make it a reality.

PS: I absolutely HATE JavaScript and C#(also most things Microsoft).\n
PS: I LOVE efficiency and security(I don't need a helping hand managing memory) so I preffer C over C++
